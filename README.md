# Logic-Calculator
Python Logic Calculator capable of calculating areas and volumes of 3D and 2D figures, as well as basic trigonometry and unit transformation
As soon as you run the code, you will notice that a message comes out asking about the decimal rounding.
Here you can introduce how you want your results to be rounded. If you leave this space empty, the programm will automatically round to 3 decimals
Then, a menu will come out, and you will have to enter the letter corresponding to the operation you want to make.
The same will happen after that, and you will have to choose in the same way.
If you choose either Areas or Trigonometry, you can fill any spaces you can or want and the programm will automatically tell you if you can make that operation with the information given.
I tried my hardest to implement every possibility for each case, however, errors may occur, so I would be very thankful if you reported it, if you see it.
